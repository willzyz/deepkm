# Deepkm: Deep Kmeans for unsupervised learning for dynamic routing 
Repository for code in deep dynamic routing with unsupervised learning. 

This repository combines the machine translation sequence2sequence code with Tensorflow, with deep-kmeans code base from Facebook, and part of code written to replicate topic-rnn for language model used in this paper.
